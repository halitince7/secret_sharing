# Coding Theory and Secret Sharing Presentation

An interactive presentation on coding theory fundamentals and Massey's secret sharing scheme, built with Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Overview

This presentation covers:

1. **Coding Theory Basics**
   - Basic concepts and definitions
   - Communication examples
   - Encoding and decoding processes
   - Distance metrics and error detection

2. **Secret Sharing**
   - Basic concepts
   - Threshold schemes
   - Access and block structures

3. **Massey's Secret Sharing Scheme**
   - Construction using linear codes
   - Relationship with minimal codewords
   - Complete working examples
   - Proofs and propositions
